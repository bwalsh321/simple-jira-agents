API Endpoints
Health Check
GET /health
Returns system status including Jira connectivity and AI model status.
Agent Endpoints

POST /api/v1/admin-validator - Custom field validation and creation
POST /api/v1/l1-triage-bot - Incident support automation
POST /api/v1/pm-enhancer - Ticket quality improvement
POST /api/v1/governance-bot - Standards enforcement

All endpoints require X-Webhook-Secret header for authentication.
Jira Automation Setup
Admin Validator Example
Trigger: Issue created with summary containing "custom field"
Action: Send web request

URL: https://your-tunnel-url/api/v1/admin-validator
Method: POST
Headers:

X-Webhook-Secret: your-webhook-secret
Content-Type: application/json


Body:

json{
  "issueKey": "{{issue.key}}",
  "issue": {
    "key": "{{issue.key}}", 
    "fields": {
      "summary": "{{issue.summary}}",
      "description": "{{issue.description}}"
    }
  }
}
Features
Admin Validator

Natural language processing: Extracts field details from plain English
Duplicate prevention: Checks all existing custom fields automatically
Auto-creation: Creates approved fields with proper Jira configuration
Comprehensive logging: Full audit trail of decisions and actions
Smart validation: Uses AI to assess field necessity and compliance

Privacy & Security

Local processing: All AI inference runs on your hardware
No data storage: Processes requests in memory only
Secure webhooks: HMAC validation and secret-based authentication
Audit trails: Complete logging without storing sensitive data

Development Journey
This project evolved from a monolithic 1000+ line script to a professional modular system:
v0.1 - Monolithic Script

Single large file with embedded logic
Proof of concept for field automation
Manual testing and configuration

v1.0 - Modular Architecture

Professional code organization
Specialized agent endpoints
Production-ready deployment
Proven field creation: Successfully automated custom field creation

Migration Benefits

Maintainable: Clear separation of concerns
Scalable: Individual agents can be deployed independently
Testable: Each component can be validated separately
Professional: Industry-standard FastAPI framework

Hardware Requirements
Tested Configuration

CPU: Intel i7-12700K
GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3090 (24GB VRAM)
RAM: 32GB DDR5
OS: Windows 11 (with Ubuntu via WSL2 option)

Performance

Model: gpt-oss:20b runs comfortably on RTX 3090
Response time: ~4-6 seconds for field validation
Throughput: Suitable for small-to-medium team usage
Scalability: Single GPU handles dozens of concurrent requests

Business Value
For IT Teams

Eliminates duplicate fields: Automatic checking prevents configuration sprawl
Reduces admin overhead: Field creation becomes self-service
Maintains standards: AI enforces naming conventions and governance
Audit compliance: Complete trail of all automated actions

For Development Teams

Faster delivery: No waiting for admin to create custom fields
Self-service: Create fields through simple Jira tickets
Quality assurance: AI validates requests before implementation
Integration ready: Works with existing Jira workflows
